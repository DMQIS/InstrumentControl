PulseTubeBoard3Off contains 60 seconds of data, the first 20 of which still have the pulse tube running (it is in the process of turning off).

PulseTubeBoard3Off2 is the trimmed version that is 40 seconds and does not have the 20 seconds where the pulse tube is still running. 

PulseTubeBoard3Off2 should be used for analysis.
